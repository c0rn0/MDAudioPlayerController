Donations
---------

I wrote MDAudioPlayerController for use in one of my own apps and realized after I had finally finished it that it could be quite useful (and very time-saving) for others

If you find it helpful, a Paypal donation would be very appreciated (mattdonnelly [at] me [dot] com) 


Easy Setup (BETA)
-----------------

A Cocoapod Podspec file has been added that will allow you to do a pod install to get up and running quickly. Eventually we'll post it to the cocoapods repo. For now, here's what your podfile should look like:

    platform :ios
    pod 'MDAudioPlayerController', :git => 'https://github.com/c0rn0/MDAudioPlayerController.git'
    
(The sample project hasn't been updated or tested against a cocoapod install. If you find any issues please let us know. This should work fine for your new project though.) 


Features
--------

* Reads ID3 tags from MP3s
* Displays track list
* Multiple tracks

Support / Contact / Bugs / Features
-----------------------------------

I can't answer any questions about how to use the code, but I'd love to read any emails telling me that you're using it, creating an app with it, or just saying thanks.

If you want to submit a feature request or bug report, feel free to get in touch. Better yet, fork the code and implement the feature/fix yourself, then submit a pull request.

Enjoy using it!
